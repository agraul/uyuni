### üí• Blockers

*Blockers found in a CI of a branch that impedes to submit that branch*

**Version reviewed to be submitted:** 4.x / Uyuni
  - Keep in mind that depending on the week, we need to be more focused on some branches due to MU submissions being prepared.

**Notes:**

- Add aditional blockers to the list following the same format
- Duplicate this section if you review multiple branches whom must be submitted during your card.
- As soon as a blocker is resolved, mark it on the list. This list must be updated ASAP, release engineers are monitoring it, also we need to track all the issues that could delay a submission
- Add additional information to a blocker in a new comment on the card, keep that list clean and simple.
