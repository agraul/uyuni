## What

In order to improve the process and better coordinate the critical things that need to be submitted in the next submission. 

- Add your squad-related issues here, which need to get in for the next submission, the earlier the better.
- Mark them as **checked when done** ideally before the Branch freeze date
- If there is some blocker, add information here and ping the PO, so we can decide if we should wait or release with that feature or fix.

**Note**: This doesn't mean you need to mention everything but only the **critical** ones.

## Deadline

Branch Freeze: **00.00.0000**
